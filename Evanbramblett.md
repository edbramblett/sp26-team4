## About Me
I am 22 years old, a junior here at UNCG. I am apart of the CS Accelerated Masters program, so ideally I graduate with my Masters in the Spring of 2028. I like to play disc golf and board games. I have a pert dog named Peanut, he is a MinPin/Chihuahua Mix, but my family owns 5 other pets, 3 more dogs and 2 cats

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to effectively learn how to work in a duo in this class. I have not work on such a long project with another person before, only other experience are shorter class group projects.
