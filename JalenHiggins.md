## About Me
I'm a computer science major here at UNCG. I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with my firends in my free time. I also play videogames sometimes aswell. I've always been interested in technology and I love learning about interesting new things. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I want to be able to master Git by the end of this and have a successful time working with my teammate. Hopefully I will have learned enough to be able to apply the knowledge to things outside the class, such as any personal projects or tasks with Git in the future.
